;; When a query is posed in Cyc using #$consistent, this is a signal 
;; for Cyc to attempt to check whether the formula within the scope of 
;; #$consistent conflicts with the accessible portions of Cyc"s knowledge 
;; base. The formula is asserted within a specialized context created for 
;; the purpose, in which Cyc then tries to derive a contradiction. If Cyc 
;; finds a contradiction, it returns "No"; if it finds no contradiction, 
;; it returns "Yes". Since it is not possible in cases like this to prove 
;; beyond a doubt that no contradiction exists, "yes" really means the 
;; formula does not conflict with Cyc"s knowledge to the extent that Cyc 
;; has been able to check in the time allotted, while "no" means that a 
;; conflict has definitely been found.
